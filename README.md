"Rust-Detection-using-Mask-RCNN" 

I trained using 15 samples. You have increase the no. of samples in order to achieve good results.
Use http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/via-1.0.6.html to get a JSON file of corroded regions and make changes to the code accordingly.

I have used transfer learning approach using MASK RCNN to detect corrosion in any image.
